{"name":"Z (Zeta Code)","body":"Zeta Code\r\n========================\r\n\r\nGo from a 10,000 ft view of the entire project down to any file simply by zooming. Zeta Code is a [ZUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_User_Interface) for programmers.\r\n![https://p.twimg.com/AvwpduGCIAAC0Qa.png:large](https://p.twimg.com/AvwpduGCIAAC0Qa.png:large)\r\n\r\nLanguages/Frameworks Supported: Java/Maven, Ruby/Gems\r\n\r\n* Java/Maven: Tested on itself\r\n* Ruby/Gems: Tested on the Rails project\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n* right-click anywhere to get the menu\r\n* click on a node to select it.\r\n* ctrl-click on a node to open an editor for it.\r\n* Three different ways of organizing nodes: Bloom, Grid, random\r\n* Choose any directionality: left-right, down, up, right-left\r\n* Time-Travel: gource-like animation of commit history (git)\r\n* Neo-Edit Editor with syntax highlighting and many other features\r\n* Press F6 in editor for runtime-debugging\r\n\r\nFuture Plans\r\n------------\r\n* Support for more languages and frameworks\r\n* Zoom-in/out using the mouse-wheel\r\n* Tasks/Working-sets: ability to save a group of files and return to them at any time.\r\n* Dependencies: Easily manage your dependencies. See which code is using what, and easily search for existing open-source software.\r\n* History: Forward/Backward history.\r\n* Testing: Integration with modern testing frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, and spock.\r\n* Plugins: for version-control, compiling, testing, etc. It will be fully extensible.\r\n* Docs: ability to quickly see code-documentation by hovering, etc.\r\n* Call-heirarchy: see the methods called by current method.\r\n* Refactoring: ability to rename methods, move methods, etc.\r\n* Preview: show real values in real-time (\"coding without blinders\")\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFirst you need to compile using Maven.\r\n\r\n\tmvn package\r\n\r\nUnzip the zip-with-lib, then you can just run the resulting jar:\r\n\r\n\tcd target/\r\n\tunzip z-0.1-beta-3-zip-with-lib.zip\r\n\tjava -jar z-0.1-beta-3/z-0.1-beta-3.jar\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n-------------\r\nThis code is still in beta, so use with caution. It is not done.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012, Adam L. Davis. All rights reserved.\r\nMade Available for use under a BSD-style license.
